Introduction
============

JQueryUI is already available with collective.js.jqueryui package.
This package try to integrate css framework ok JQueryUI in Plone
with the ability to build a theme and to import a theme.

Notes
=====

A JQueryUI theme need more than just a css file. It needs images generated
by the theme builder on jqueryui website.

The system by default will provide on theme based on sunburst
with an import form.

I will not be able to create the theme roller app within plone because we need
to generate images.



TODO
====

* Remove the need of javascript
* Provide JQueryUI preloaded themes

JQueryUI Preloaded Themes
=========================

There are a set of available theme define by jqueryui itself. All of them
are available and can be used just by selecting it in the add-on backoffice.
